# **REACT PROJECT - TREMOR DASHBOARD**

### Overview:

- This is an internal project which will demonstrate the dashboard like a real system.
- [Design](https://demos.creative-tim.com/nextjs-material-dashboard-pro/dashboards/analytics)

### Timeline:

- Estimate time: 6 weeks (Start date: 28 Dec, 2023 - End date: 15 Feb, 2024).

### Libraries:
- [React](https://react.dev/learn): is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/): React Hook Form reduces the amount of code you need to write while removing unnecessary re-renders.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/): Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start): is a standard library for routing in React.
- [Tremor](https://www.tremor.so/): Modular components to build dashboards in a breeze. Fully open-source, made by data scientists and software engineers with a sweet spot for design.
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand):A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution. Zustand has a comfy API based on hooks. It isn't boilerplate or opinionated, but has enough convention to be explicit and flux-like.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): captures the rendered state of a UI component. Developers write multiple stories per component that describe all the "interesting" states a component can support.
- Editor: Visual Studio Code.

### Testing

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/): Simple and complete testing utilities that encourage good testing practices. Is a light-weight solution for testing web pages by querying and interacting with DOM nodes.

### Debug tool

- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) React Developer Tools is a Chrome DevTools extension for the open-source React JavaScript library. It allows you to inspect the React component hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools.
- [Responsively App](https://responsively.app/): A simple application for developing, help dev test design in many screens.
